    NEWS--SEPT 9,2024</h1>
        Hello,

        At Supercell, the only thing we love more than making the best games is the 
        brilliant people who bring that vision to life.
        
        That’s why we’re excited that Gerard Griffin is joining the clan as Supercell’s 
        new Chief Financial Officer. Ger, as he prefers to be called, brings more than 25 
        years of finance and business leadership experience from companies within 
        the gaming, media and technology sectors including NBC, EA, Zynga, and, most 
        recently, Sportradar. 
        
        <b>Our CEO and co-founder Ilkka Paananen has warmly welcomed Ger to the 
        Supercell team:</b><i>“Ger knows what it takes to build and grow great companies. 
        We have a long history of building great games, and Ger’s leadership will help 
        us continue to build an even better business alongside this. His passion for 
        games, extensive experience, and of course, special Irish sense of humor that 
        seems to be a great match with the Supercell culture, will help us in leveling up.”</i>
        
        <b>Ger says:</b><i>“I’m thrilled to be joining the amazing team at Supercell and working 
        with Ilkka and the leadership team in creatively growing our games and 
        business. I am excited for the future as we continue to innovate and scale our 
        best in class games portfolio and highly engaged player base.”</i>
        
        Rest assured: our outgoing CFO, Janne Snellman, is not going anywhere! Janne 
        will remain an invaluable member of the leadership team. He will shift his focus 
        to existing and future growth initiatives including supporting investee 
        companies.
        
        Thanks for reading; time to get back to talking about the games now!</p></pre>
